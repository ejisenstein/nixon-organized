Included in this Repository are a Jupyter Notebook, 3 Pickled Files, and a Final Presentation of this Project in Powerpoint format. 

In this project, I attempted to Structure and Filter the Nixon Tapes. They were searchable by both Topic and Date. It spans over 14 topics and from March to April of 1973. All topics relate to the Watergate Scandal and Nixon's response. 

I will continue adding more details, specifically regarding the cleaning process.
